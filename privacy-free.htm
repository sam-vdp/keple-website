		<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
		<p>This privacy policy applies to the unpaid version of KEPLE for both iOS and Android. If you are using the paid version, please refer the <a href="privacy-full.htm">privacy policy for paid apps.</a> </p>
		<h2>Crashlytics</h2>
		<p>This app uses Crashlytics to analyze crashes and improve the quality of the app. Crashlytics automatically collects certain information that does not personally identify End Users who access or use the app. This information includes, but is not limited to, device state information, unique device identifiers, device hardware and OS information, information relating to how an application functions, and the physical location of a device at the time of a crash. The information Crashlytics collects about End Users and their activities is the property of the Developer, not of Crashlytics. The information collected by the Services from End Users is used to provide Developers with insight into the functionality of and engagement with their applications, including any problems that occur. Our algorithms process and analyze the data separately for each Developer. However, Crashlytics may aggregate information across Developers in a nonpersonally identifiable way. Such aggregate and anonymous information is used by Crashlytics to (i) improve the Services, (ii) create analysis of trends or behaviors, and (iii) other similar uses, but always in an aggregate and anonymous way.</p>
		
		<h2>Firebase Analytics and AdMob</h2>
		<p>This app uses Firebase Analytics to analyze player progress in the game and improve the playing experience. Analytics collects the following information that does not personally identify end users: which levels have been attempted, cancelled or completed, including the number of attempts; collected hearts; unlocked bonuses. This information is only collected in anonymized form.</p>
		<p>Additionally this app uses AdMob to display advertisements to the user. AdMob uses Apple's advertising identifier (IDFA) on iOS and the Android Advertising ID on Android to identify the user. These identifiers can be reset by the user at any time and are not personally identifiable information.</p>
